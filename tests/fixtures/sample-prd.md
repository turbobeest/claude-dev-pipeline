# Product Requirements Document - User Authentication System

## Overview
Build a comprehensive user authentication system for a web application that supports user registration, login, password management, and role-based access control.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration
- Users can create accounts with email and password
- Email validation required before account activation
- Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers)
- Duplicate email prevention
- Optional profile information (name, avatar)

### 2. User Authentication
- Secure login with email/password
- Session management with JWT tokens
- "Remember me" functionality
- Account lockout after failed attempts (5 attempts)
- Password reset via email link

### 3. Authorization & Roles
- Role-based access control (Admin, User, Guest)
- Permission system for resources
- Admin panel for user management
- User profile management

### 4. Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting on login endpoints
- CSRF protection
- Secure cookie handling
- Account verification emails

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Node.js with Express framework
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- JWT for session management
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Nodemailer for email service
- Rate limiting middleware

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Form validation with Formik
- Material-UI components

### Database Schema
```sql
Users table:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- email (VARCHAR, unique)
- password_hash (VARCHAR)
- first_name (VARCHAR)
- last_name (VARCHAR)
- role (ENUM: admin, user, guest)
- email_verified (BOOLEAN)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
- last_login (TIMESTAMP)

Sessions table:
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key)
- token_hash (VARCHAR)
- expires_at (TIMESTAMP)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/auth/refresh
- POST /api/auth/forgot-password
- POST /api/auth/reset-password
- GET /api/auth/verify-email/:token

### User Management
- GET /api/users/profile
- PUT /api/users/profile
- DELETE /api/users/account
- GET /api/admin/users (admin only)
- PUT /api/admin/users/:id (admin only)

## Security Considerations
- All passwords must be hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens should expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens valid for 30 days
- Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per IP per minute
- Email verification required for new accounts
- HTTPS required in production

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user flows
- Security testing for authentication
- Performance testing for concurrent users

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Registration
- [x] User can register with valid email and password
- [x] System validates email format and password strength
- [x] Verification email sent on registration
- [x] Account only activated after email verification
- [x] Duplicate email registrations are rejected

### User Authentication
- [x] User can login with correct credentials
- [x] Invalid credentials are rejected with appropriate message
- [x] Account locks after 5 failed attempts
- [x] JWT token generated on successful login
- [x] Session expires after configured time

### Password Management
- [x] User can request password reset
- [x] Reset link sent via email with expiration
- [x] User can set new password via reset link
- [x] Old password is invalidated after reset

### Role-Based Access
- [x] Different user roles have appropriate permissions
- [x] Admin can manage all users
- [x] Users can only access their own data
- [x] Unauthorized access attempts are blocked

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: < 200ms for authentication requests
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Scalability: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Compliance: GDPR compliant for EU users
