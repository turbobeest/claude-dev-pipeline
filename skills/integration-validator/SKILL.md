# Integration Validator Skill

## Activation Method

This skill activates when the hook system injects the codeword:
```
[ACTIVATE:INTEGRATION_VALIDATOR_V1]
```

This occurs when:
- Phase 3 implementation is complete
- architecture.md is read
- Task #24 (integration testing) is active

## Worktree Isolation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This skill MUST operate in a dedicated worktree `phase-4-task-1`:

```bash
# Before skill activation:
./lib/worktree-manager.sh create 4 1
cd ./worktrees/phase-4-task-1

# Validate isolation:
./hooks/worktree-enforcer.sh enforce

# Integration validation with isolation
```

### Integration Testing Isolation
1. **Isolated test environment**: Integration tests run in dedicated worktree
2. **Clean test state**: No interference from other testing activities
3. **Integration point analysis**: Architecture parsing done in isolation
4. **Test artifact isolation**: Integration test results contained within worktree
5. **Validation merge**: Results merged only after complete validation


# Integration Validator Skill

## What This Skill Does

Systematically validates production readiness through worktree-isolated testing:
- **Integration Point Detection:** Parses architecture.md in isolated environment
- **Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing integration tests (target: 100% coverage)
- **E2E Validation:** Verifies all critical user workflows tested in isolation
- **Production Readiness Scoring:** Objective 0-100% score (≥90% required for GO)
- **Remediation Plans:** Detailed action items to address gaps
- **NEW**: Isolated integration testing prevents test contamination
- **NEW**: Clean test environment ensures accurate validation results

## What This Skill Does

### 1. Architecture Integration Point Analysis
Parses `docs/architecture.md` to extract:
- All components in system
- Integration points between components
- External service integrations
- Data flows
- API contracts

### 2. Integration Test Coverage Validation
Verifies:
- Every integration point has tests
- Every component interaction tested
- Every external service integration tested
- Error propagation tested
- Performance benchmarks tested

### 3. Production Readiness Checklist
Generates and validates comprehensive checklist from:
- PRD Section 4.3 requirements
- Industry best practices
- Architecture-specific requirements
- Security standards
- Performance targets

### 4. Gap Analysis
Identifies:
- Missing integration tests
- Untested integration points
- Incomplete documentation
- Missing monitoring
- Security gaps
- Performance bottlenecks

```markdown
## Integration Point: API Gateway ↔ Auth Service

**Type:** Service-to-Service
**Protocol:** REST API / JWT
**Critical:** YES (authentication)

### Required Tests:

1. **Happy Path:**

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] Token at exact expiry boundary
   - [ ] Token with extra claims (ignored gracefully)
   - [ ] Token from old version (backward compatibility)

4. **Performance:**
   - [ ] Token validation < 10ms p95
   - [ ] Caching working (Redis)
   - [ ] High concurrent requests handled

5. **Integration Test Files:**

Operational:   75% × 0.20 = 15%
Documentation: 70% × 0.15 = 10.5%
Stakeholder:   25% × 0.10 = 2.5%
-----------------------------------
TOTAL:                     58.5%

THRESHOLD FOR PRODUCTION:  ≥90%
```

**STATUS:** 🚨 NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

## Blocking Issues (Must Be Resolved)

### Critical (Cannot Deploy):
1. ⛔ Integration test coverage only 67% (need 100%)
2. ⛔ Load testing not completed
3. ⛔ OWASP ZAP scan not completed
4. ⛔ Alerts not tested (potential production blindness)
5. ⛔ Rollback not tested (cannot recover from bad deploy)

### High Priority (Should Resolve):
6. ⚠️ 2 moderate security vulnerabilities
7. ⚠️ Architecture documentation outdated
8. ⚠️ Runbook missing
9. ⚠️ No stakeholder sign-offs

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have):
10. ⚠️ E2E Safari/Mobile testing incomplete

## Remediation Plan

**Phase 1 (Critical) - ETA: 2-3 days**
1. Complete missing integration tests (4 tests)
2. Run load testing (1 day)
3. Run OWASP ZAP scan (2 hours)
4. Test all alerts (2 hours)
5. Test rollback procedure (4 hours)

**Phase 2 (High Priority) - ETA: 1 day**
6. Update dependencies (address vulnerabilities)
7. Update architecture documentation
8. Create runbook
9. Obtain stakeholder sign-offs

**Phase 3 (Medium Priority) - ETA: 4 hours**
10. Complete Safari/Mobile E2E tests

**EARLIEST PRODUCTION READY DATE:** 4-5 days from now

## Go/No-Go Decision

**CURRENT DECISION:** 🚨 NO-GO

**RATIONALE:**
- Only 58.5% production ready (need ≥90%)
- 5 critical blocking issues unresolved
- Integration test coverage insufficient
- Load testing not completed
- Critical operational procedures untested

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Execute remediation plan Phase 1 & 2 before reconsidering Go decision.
