# Integration Validator Skill

## Activation Method

This skill activates when the hook system injects the codeword:
```
[ACTIVATE:INTEGRATION_VALIDATOR_V1]
```

This occurs when:
- Phase 3 implementation is complete
- architecture.md is read
- Task #24 (integration testing) is active

## Worktree Isolation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This skill MUST operate in a dedicated worktree `phase-4-task-1`:

```bash
# Before skill activation:
./lib/worktree-manager.sh create 4 1
cd ./worktrees/phase-4-task-1

# Validate isolation:
./hooks/worktree-enforcer.sh enforce

# Integration validation with isolation
```

### Integration Testing Isolation
1. **Isolated test environment**: Integration tests run in dedicated worktree
2. **Clean test state**: No interference from other testing activities
3. **Integration point analysis**: Architecture parsing done in isolation
4. **Test artifact isolation**: Integration test results contained within worktree
5. **Validation merge**: Results merged only after complete validation


# Integration Validator Skill

## What This Skill Does

Systematically validates production readiness through worktree-isolated testing:
- **Integration Point Detection:** Parses architecture.md in isolated environment
- **Gap Analysis:** Identifies missing integration tests (target: 100% coverage)
- **E2E Validation:** Verifies all critical user workflows tested in isolation
- **Production Readiness Scoring:** Objective 0-100% score (≥90% required for GO)
- **Remediation Plans:** Detailed action items to address gaps
- **NEW**: Isolated integration testing prevents test contamination
- **NEW**: Clean test environment ensures accurate validation results

## What This Skill Does

### 1. Architecture Integration Point Analysis
Parses `docs/architecture.md` to extract:
- All components in system
- Integration points between components
- External service integrations
- Data flows
- API contracts

### 2. Integration Test Coverage Validation
Verifies:
- Every integration point has tests
- Every component interaction tested
- Every external service integration tested
- Error propagation tested
- Performance benchmarks tested

### 3. Production Readiness Checklist
Generates and validates comprehensive checklist from:
- PRD Section 4.3 requirements
- Industry best practices
- Architecture-specific requirements
- Security standards
- Performance targets

### 4. Gap Analysis
Identifies:
- Missing integration tests
- Untested integration points
- Incomplete documentation
- Missing monitoring
- Security gaps
- Performance bottlenecks

## Task #24 Validation (Component Integration)

**Automatically generates validation checklist:**

```markdown
# Task #24: Component Integration Testing Validation

## Pre-Execution Checklist

**Prerequisites:**
- [x] All feature tasks complete (Tasks 1-23)
- [x] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration test framework configured
- [ ] Test database populated with fixtures

## Integration Point Coverage Matrix

| Integration Point | Test File | Status | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| API Gateway ↔ Auth | api-gateway-auth.test.js | ✅ TESTED | All scenarios covered |
| Auth ↔ Database | auth-database.test.js | ✅ TESTED | CRUD + transactions |

**Status:** 4/6 tested (67%) - INSUFFICIENT

## Integration Test Execution

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npm test:integration

# Expected output:
# ✅ api-gateway-auth.test.js: 12 tests passing
# ✅ auth-database.test.js: 8 tests passing
# ✅ product-database.test.js: 10 tests passing
# ❌ order-payment.test.js: FILE NOT FOUND
# ⚠️ order-email.test.js: 3/5 tests passing
# ❌ user-email.test.js: FILE NOT FOUND
```

## Remediation Tasks

**Before marking Task #24 complete:**

1. **Create Missing Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Create order-payment integration test
   touch tests/integration/order-payment.test.js
   # Implement Stripe test mode integration
   
   # Create user-email integration test
   touch tests/integration/user-email.test.js
   # Implement SendGrid test mode integration
   ```

2. **Complete Incomplete Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Add error scenarios to order-email.test.js:
   # - Email service timeout
   # - Invalid email address
   # - Rate limiting
   ```

3. **Validate All Tests Pass:**
   ```bash
   npm test:integration
   # All tests must pass (100%)
   ```

## Validation Gates

**Task #24 CANNOT be marked complete until:**
- [ ] All 6 integration points tested (100%)
- [ ] All integration tests passing (100%)
- [ ] No errors in service logs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Integration test report generated

**Current Status:** 🚨 BLOCKED - 2 missing tests, 1 incomplete test
```

## Automated Validation Hooks

**CRITICAL: Before Task #26, run automated validation hooks:**

### 1. Security Validation
```bash
./hooks/security-validator.sh
```

**What it validates:**
- npm/pip dependency vulnerabilities (blocks on critical/high)
- Container image security (Trivy scan)
- Secrets detection (Gitleaks)
- SAST scanning (Semgrep if configured)

**Exit codes:**
- 0 = PASSED (can proceed)
- 1 = FAILED (blocks deployment)

**Required tools** (install if missing):
```bash
# Node.js security
npm install -g npm

# Python security (optional)
pip install pip-audit

# Container scanning (optional but recommended)
brew install trivy

# Secrets detection (optional but recommended)
brew install gitleaks

# SAST scanning (optional)
pip install semgrep
```

---

### 2. Load Test Validation
```bash
./hooks/load-test-validator.sh
```

**What it validates:**
- Detects load test framework (k6, Artillery, Locust, npm script)
- Executes load tests automatically
- Validates results against PRD requirements

**Supported frameworks:**
- k6 (recommended): Create `k6-load-test.js`
- Artillery: Create `artillery.yml`
- Locust: Create `locustfile.py`
- npm: Add `"load:test"` script to package.json

**Exit codes:**
- 0 = PASSED
- 1 = FAILED or no load tests found

---

### 3. Performance Validation
```bash
./hooks/performance-validator.sh
```

**What it validates:**
- Extracts performance targets from PRD
- Runs performance tests
- Compares actual vs required metrics
- Validates latency (p95, p99, avg)
- Validates throughput (req/sec)

**Exit codes:**
- 0 = PASSED or no requirements in PRD
- 1 = FAILED (performance targets not met)

---

### Integration into Task #26 Workflow

**UPDATED Production Readiness Validation:**

```bash
# Step 1: Run automated security validation
echo "Running security validation..."
./hooks/security-validator.sh || exit 1

# Step 2: Run load testing
echo "Running load tests..."
./hooks/load-test-validator.sh || exit 1

# Step 3: Validate performance
echo "Validating performance targets..."
./hooks/performance-validator.sh || exit 1

# Step 4: Manual checks (if automated passes)
echo "Automated validations PASSED"
echo "Proceed with manual production readiness checklist..."
```

## Parallel Subagent Execution

For faster validation, run independent validation tasks in parallel:

### Step 1: Identify Independent Validations

These validation tasks have no dependencies and can run simultaneously:

| Validation | Dependencies | Can Parallelize |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Security scanning | None | ✅ Yes |
| Load testing | Staging deployed | ✅ Yes |
| Performance validation | Staging deployed | ✅ Yes |
| E2E browser tests (Chrome) | Staging deployed | ✅ Yes |
| E2E browser tests (Firefox) | Staging deployed | ✅ Yes |
| E2E browser tests (Safari) | Staging deployed | ✅ Yes |
| Integration tests | Code complete | ✅ Yes |
| Documentation review | None | ✅ Yes |

### Step 2: Launch Parallel Validation Subagents

Use Claude Code's Task tool to run validations in parallel:

```
Launch 6 parallel subagents for integration validation:

Subagent 1 - Security Validation:
  - Run ./hooks/security-validator.sh
  - Check npm/pip vulnerabilities
  - Run container security scan
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with details

Subagent 2 - Load Testing:
  - Run ./hooks/load-test-validator.sh
  - Execute k6/Artillery load tests
  - Validate against PRD thresholds
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with metrics

Subagent 3 - Performance Validation:
  - Run ./hooks/performance-validator.sh
  - Check p95/p99 latency
  - Validate throughput targets
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with metrics

Subagent 4 - E2E Chrome Tests:
  - Run npm test:e2e:chrome
  - Capture screenshots on failure
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with results

Subagent 5 - E2E Firefox/Safari Tests:
  - Run npm test:e2e:firefox
  - Run npm test:e2e:safari
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with results

Subagent 6 - Integration Tests:
  - Run npm test:integration
  - Validate all integration points
  - Report: PASSED/FAILED with coverage
```

### Step 3: Aggregate Results

After all subagents complete:

```bash
# Collect validation results
echo "=== VALIDATION SUMMARY ==="
echo "Security:    $SECURITY_RESULT"
echo "Load Test:   $LOADTEST_RESULT"
echo "Performance: $PERF_RESULT"
echo "E2E Chrome:  $E2E_CHROME_RESULT"
echo "E2E FF/Saf:  $E2E_OTHER_RESULT"
echo "Integration: $INTEGRATION_RESULT"

# All must pass for GO decision
if [[ "$SECURITY_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]] && \
   [[ "$LOADTEST_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]] && \
   [[ "$PERF_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]] && \
   [[ "$E2E_CHROME_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]] && \
   [[ "$E2E_OTHER_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]] && \
   [[ "$INTEGRATION_RESULT" == "PASSED" ]]; then
  echo "✅ ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED - Proceed to deployment"
else
  echo "❌ VALIDATION FAILED - See individual reports"
fi
```

### Performance Comparison

| Method | Full Validation | Speed |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Sequential | 2-4 hours | 1x |
| 6 Parallel Subagents | 30-60 min | 4x |

**Note:** Parallel validation requires staging environment already deployed

**Automated validation replaces manual checklists for:**
- ✅ Security scanning (was manual checkbox)
- ✅ Load testing execution (was manual checkbox)
- ✅ Performance validation (was manual checkbox)

**Manual validation still required for:**
- Stakeholder sign-offs
- Documentation review
- Operational runbook verification
