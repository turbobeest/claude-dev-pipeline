## 📋 The 4 Skills

| Skill | When It Activates | What It Does |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **prd-to-tasks** | Mention "generate tasks", "PRD", or view PRD.md | Generates tasks.json from PRD with integration tasks |
| **coupling-analysis** | Run `task-master show` or mention "coupling" | Determines if tasks are tightly/loosely coupled for proposal strategy |
| **test-strategy-generator** | Create OpenSpec proposal or mention "test strategy" | Generates 60/30/10 test distribution with templates |
| **integration-validator** | View architecture.md or start Tasks #24-26 | Validates integration points and production readiness |

---

## 🪝 The 3 Hooks

| Hook | Type | What It Does |
|------|------|--------------|
| **skill-activation-prompt** | UserPromptSubmit | Auto-suggests skills based on message + context |
| **post-tool-use-tracker** | PostToolUse | Tracks workflow progress, suggests next-phase skills |
| **pre-implementation-validator** | PreToolUse | Blocks implementation if tests don't exist (TDD enforcer) |

---

## 🔄 Workflow Progression

```
Phase 1: Task Decomposition
  User: "Generate tasks from PRD"
  Hook: Activates prd-to-tasks
  Result: tasks.json created
  Hook: Suggests coupling-analysis
    ↓
Phase 2: Specification  
  User: "Show task 5"
  Hook: Activates coupling-analysis
  Result: Determines proposal strategy
  User: "Create OpenSpec proposal"
  Hook: Suggests test-strategy-generator
    ↓
Phase 3: TDD Implementation
  User: "Implement feature"
  Hook: BLOCKS - "Write tests first!"
  User: "Write tests"
  Hook: ✅ Tests written first
  User: "Now implement"
  Hook: ✅ Allows implementation
    ↓
Phase 4-6: Integration & Production
  User: "Read architecture.md"
  Hook: Activates integration-validator
  Result: Production readiness score
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After installation:

- [ ] Skills exist: `ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (should list 4)
- [ ] Hooks exist: `ls .claude/hooks/*.sh` (should list 3)
- [ ] Hooks executable: `ls -l .claude/hooks/` (should show 'x' permission)
- [ ] Config exists: `cat .claude/skill-rules.json`
- [ ] Settings exist: `cat .claude/settings.json`

## 🧪 Test Commands

### Test Skill Activation
```bash
# In Claude Code
"Can you help me generate tasks from a PRD?"
# Expected: 📋 Relevant Skills Detected: prd-to-tasks
```

### Test Workflow Tracking
```bash
# Create a file
touch .taskmaster/tasks.json
# Expected: 🎯 Workflow Transition Detected - Next Skill: coupling-analysis
```

### Test TDD Enforcement
```bash
# Try to create implementation without tests
touch src/feature.js
# Expected: ❌ TDD VIOLATION - Tests must be written FIRST
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### skill-rules.json
Defines skill activation patterns:
```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "skill": "prd-to-tasks",
      "triggers": ["generate tasks", "parse prd"],
      "filePatterns": ["PRD.md", "requirements.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### settings.json
Maps hooks to events:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [...],
    "PostToolUse": [...],
    "PreToolUse": [...]
  }
}
```

### .workflow-state.json (auto-generated)
Tracks progress:
```json
{
  "phase": "phase2-in-progress",
  "signals": {
    "tasks_created": 1698765432,
    "proposal_created": 1698765789
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Hook not running | `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh` |
| Skill not activating | Check skill-rules.json patterns |
| TDD not enforcing | Verify PreToolUse hook in settings.json |
| State not updating | Check jq installed: `which jq` |
| Debug mode | `export CLAUDE_DEBUG_HOOKS=1` |

---

## 📊 Workflow State Phases

| Phase | Description | Triggered By |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `pre-init` | Before tasks.json exists | Initial state |
| `phase1-complete` | tasks.json created | Write tasks.json |
| `phase2-in-progress` | Creating proposals | Write .openspec/proposals |
| `phase3-tdd` | TDD implementation | Write test files |
| `phase4-integration` | Integration testing | Read architecture.md |
| `phase5-e2e` | E2E workflows | Task #25 |
| `phase6-production` | Production validation | Task #26 |

---

## 🎯 Key Commands

```bash
# Initialize project
task-master init
openspec init --tools claude

# View tasks
task-master show

# Create proposal
openspec proposal create

# Run tests
npm test  # or pytest, etc.

# Check coverage
npm run coverage
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Customize skill-rules.json** for your team's vocabulary
2. **Add project-specific hooks** for custom workflows
3. **Use workflow state** to resume after context resets
4. **Check hook logs** for debugging: `tail -f ~/.claude/logs/hooks.log`
5. **Test hooks independently** before full workflow
