## Phase Transition Flow

```
Phase 1: PRD → tasks.json
    ↓ [PHASE1_COMPLETE]
Phase 2: tasks.json → specifications
    ↓ [PHASE2_SPECS_CREATED]
Phase 3: specs → implementation (TDD)
    ↓ [PHASE3_COMPLETE]
Phase 4: code → integration tests
    ↓ [PHASE4_COMPLETE]
Phase 5: integration → E2E validation
    ↓ [PHASE5_COMPLETE + GO_DECISION]
Phase 6: validation → deployment
    ↓ [DEPLOYED_TO_PRODUCTION]
```
