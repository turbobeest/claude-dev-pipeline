# Development Workflow Guide - Codeword System

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the **Claude Dev Pipeline** with its revolutionary codeword-based autonomous system. Instead of hoping Claude notices keywords, this system uses deterministic codewords injected by hooks to guarantee 100% skill activation.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the pipeline
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/claude-dev-pipeline.git

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Run installer
bash /path/to/claude-dev-pipeline/install-pipeline.sh

# Verify installation
ls -la .claude/
```

### 2. Start Development

```bash
# In Claude Code
User: "I've completed my PRD, begin automated development"

# System responds:
🎯 **SKILL ACTIVATION SYSTEM**
[ACTIVATE:PIPELINE_ORCHESTRATION_V1]
[ACTIVATE:PRD_TO_TASKS_V1]

**Active Skills:**
- pipeline-orchestration
- prd-to-tasks

# Pipeline starts automatically...
```

---

## Phase-by-Phase Workflow

### Phase 0: Preparation (Manual)

**What You Do:**
1. Create your PRD document
2. Validate requirements
3. Ensure prerequisites are met

**Trigger Pipeline:**
```
"Phase 0 complete, begin automated development"
```

**What Happens:**
- Hook detects trigger phrase
- Injects `[ACTIVATE:PIPELINE_ORCHESTRATION_V1]`
- Master orchestrator starts
- Automatically triggers Phase 1

---

### Phase 1: Task Decomposition (Automated)

**Automatic Flow:**
```
[ACTIVATE:PRD_TO_TASKS_V1]
    ↓
Generate tasks.json
    ↓
[SIGNAL:PHASE1_START]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:COUPLING_ANALYSIS_V1]
    ↓
Analyze coupling
    ↓
[SIGNAL:COUPLING_ANALYZED]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:TASK_DECOMPOSER_V1]
    ↓
Expand complex tasks
    ↓
[SIGNAL:PHASE1_COMPLETE]
```

**Skills Involved:**
- `PRD_TO_TASKS_V1` - Creates initial task list
- `COUPLING_ANALYSIS_V1` - Determines parallelization
- `TASK_DECOMPOSER_V1` - Breaks down complex tasks

**Outputs:**
- `tasks.json` with all tasks and subtasks
- Coupling analysis report
- Complexity scores

**No manual intervention required!**

---

### Phase 2: Specification Generation (Automated)

**Automatic Flow:**
```
[SIGNAL:PHASE1_COMPLETE]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:SPEC_GEN_V1]
    ↓
Create OpenSpec proposals
    ↓
[SIGNAL:PHASE2_SPECS_CREATED]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:TEST_STRATEGY_V1]
    ↓
Generate test strategies
    ↓
[SIGNAL:TEST_STRATEGY_COMPLETE]
```

**Skills Involved:**
- `SPEC_GEN_V1` - Creates detailed specifications
- `TEST_STRATEGY_V1` - Generates 60/30/10 test distribution

**Outputs:**
- `.openspec/proposals/*.md` files
- Test strategy documentation
- TDD approach guidelines

**Batching for Large Projects:**
- Automatic batching for 30+ tasks
- 5-10 tasks per batch
- Fresh context for each batch

---

### Phase 3: Implementation (Manual Gate + TDD Enforced)

**Manual Gate Required:**
```
"Proceed with implementation"
```

**TDD Enforcement Cycle:**

#### Step 1: Write Tests First (RED)
```
User: Tries to create src/feature.js

System: ❌ BLOCKED
"Write tests first: tests/feature.test.js"

User: Creates tests/feature.test.js

System: ✅ TDD: Tests written first (CORRECT)
[SIGNAL:TESTS_WRITTEN]
```

#### Step 2: Write Implementation (GREEN)
```
User: Now creates src/feature.js

System: ✅ ALLOWED: Tests exist
[SIGNAL:IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE]
```

#### Step 3: Refactor (REFACTOR)
- Improve code quality
- Tests must stay green
- Coverage validation (80%/70%)

**Completion:**
```
All tests pass → [SIGNAL:PHASE3_COMPLETE]
```

---

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (Automated)

**Automatic Flow:**
```
[SIGNAL:PHASE3_COMPLETE]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:INTEGRATION_VALIDATOR_V1]
    ↓
Execute Task #24
    ↓
Test all integration points
    ↓
[SIGNAL:PHASE4_COMPLETE]
```

**What Gets Tested:**
- Component interactions
- API contracts
- Data flow
- Error handling

**No manual intervention required!**

---

### Phase 5: E2E Validation (Automated + Decision Gate)

**Automatic Flow:**
```
[SIGNAL:PHASE4_COMPLETE]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:E2E_VALIDATOR_V1]
    ↓
Execute Task #25
    ↓
Test user workflows
    ↓
[SIGNAL:PHASE5_COMPLETE]
```

**GO/NO-GO Decision Required:**
```
System: 🔴 GO/NO-GO DECISION REQUIRED

Review test results and decide:
- Say "GO" to approve deployment
- Say "NO-GO" to halt

User: "GO"

System: ✅ GO DECISION RECORDED
[SIGNAL:GO_DECISION]
```

---

### Phase 6: Deployment (After Approval)

**Automatic After GO:**
```
[SIGNAL:GO_DECISION]
    ↓
[ACTIVATE:DEPLOYMENT_ORCHESTRATOR_V1]
    ↓
Execute Task #26
    ↓
Deploy to production
    ↓
[SIGNAL:DEPLOYED_TO_PRODUCTION]
```

**Deployment Steps:**
- Build production artifacts
- Run final validations
- Deploy to environment
- Verify deployment

---

## Understanding Codewords

### What Are Codewords?

Codewords are unique identifiers that guarantee skill activation:

```
Traditional: User says "generate tasks" → Claude might miss it
Codeword:    User says "generate tasks" → Hook injects [ACTIVATE:PRD_TO_TASKS_V1]
```

### How Hooks Use Codewords

1. **UserPromptSubmit Hook** analyzes your message
2. Detects intent (e.g., "generate tasks")
3. Injects appropriate codeword
4. Skill with matching `activation_code` activates immediately

### Codeword Format

```
[ACTIVATE:SKILL_NAME_VERSION]

Examples:
[ACTIVATE:PRD_TO_TASKS_V1]
[ACTIVATE:TEST_STRATEGY_V1]
[ACTIVATE:DEPLOYMENT_ORCHESTRATOR_V1]
```

---

## Monitoring Pipeline Progress

### Check Current Status

```
User: "What's the pipeline status?"

System: 📊 Pipeline Status
Current Phase: phase3
Last Signal: TESTS_WRITTEN

Phase Status:
✅ PHASE1 - Complete
✅ PHASE2 - Complete
⏳ PHASE3 - In Progress
⏳ PHASE4 - Pending
⏳ PHASE5 - Pending
⏳ PHASE6 - Pending
```

### View Signals

```bash
# Check workflow state
cat .claude/.workflow-state.json

# View signal history
ls -la .claude/.signals/
```

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Starting Fresh Project

```
1. Create PRD.md
2. Say: "Begin automated development"
3. Watch Phases 1-2 complete automatically
4. Say: "Proceed with implementation"
5. Write tests → code → refactor
6. Watch Phases 4-5 complete automatically
7. Make GO/NO-GO decision
8. Watch deployment complete
```

### Scenario 2: Resuming After Break

```
1. Say: "What's the pipeline status?"
2. System shows current phase
3. Say: "Continue pipeline"
4. Automation resumes from last signal
```

### Scenario 3: Handling Errors

```
If error occurs:
1. Fix the issue
2. Say: "Retry last phase"
3. System re-injects last activation code
4. Phase retries with fresh context
```

### Scenario 4: Large Project (50+ tasks)

```
System automatically:
1. Detects large task count
2. Batches into 5-10 task groups
3. Processes each batch with fresh context
4. Maintains quality throughout
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

```bash
# Check if codeword was injected
echo "generate tasks" | bash .claude/hooks/skill-activation-prompt.sh

# Should see:
[ACTIVATE:PRD_TO_TASKS_V1]
```

### Phase Not Progressing

```bash
# Check last signal
cat .claude/.workflow-state.json | jq '.lastSignal'

# Manually trigger next phase
echo "Continue pipeline"
```

### TDD Violation

```
If you see: ❌ BLOCKED: Write tests first

Solution:
1. Write test file first
2. Then write implementation
3. System will allow it
```

### Lost State

```bash
# State persists in:
.claude/.workflow-state.json

# Signals saved in:
.claude/.signals/

# Can resume anytime
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Trust the Automation
- Let phases 1-2 run completely uninterrupted
- Don't manually intervene unless at a gate

### 2. Review at Gates
- Take time at manual gates to review
- Ensure specs look correct before implementation
- Carefully make GO/NO-GO decision

### 3. Follow TDD
- Always write tests first
- The hook will enforce this anyway
- Better to embrace it than fight it

### 4. Use Status Checks
- Regularly ask "pipeline status"
- Monitor signal emissions
- Track coverage metrics

### 5. Let Batching Work
- For large projects, trust the batching
- Don't try to process all at once
- Quality > Speed

## Advanced Features

### Custom Codewords

Add your own skills with custom codes:
```yaml
activation_code: MY_CUSTOM_SKILL_V1
```

### Signal Handlers

React to specific signals:
```bash
if [[ "$SIGNAL" == "PHASE3_COMPLETE" ]]; then
  # Custom action
fi
```

### Parallel Execution

When coupling analysis shows independence:
```
Tasks 3,4,5 - Can run in parallel
System handles this automatically
```

### Version Management

Use versioned codewords:
```
PRD_TO_TASKS_V1 - Original
PRD_TO_TASKS_V2 - Enhanced
Both can coexist
```
