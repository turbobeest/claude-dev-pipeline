C. OpenSpec Integration Notes
Specification Structure: This PRD will generate OpenSpec specs in the following structure:

openspec/specs/
├── [component-1]/
│   └── spec.md          # Maps to Feature [ID], FRs [ID].1-[ID].N
├── [component-2]/
│   └── spec.md          # Maps to Feature [ID], FRs [ID].1-[ID].N
└── integration/
    └── spec.md          # Maps to Section 4 (Integration & System Testing)

Proposal Creation Strategy:
- Tightly coupled features (share code/models): One OpenSpec proposal per feature
- Loosely coupled features (independent components): One OpenSpec proposal per major FR
- Integration tasks: Separate OpenSpec proposal for system integration


Template Usage Instructions for AI Task Generation (Claude Projects):

When generating tasks.json from this PRD:
1. Create one top-level task per feature (Feature [ID])
2. Create one top-level task for "Testing Infrastructure Setup"
3. Create one top-level task for "Integration & System Validation" (maps to Section 4)
4. Create one top-level task for "Operational Readiness"
5. Each task should have:
- Clear title matching PRD section
- Description extracted from PRD
- Dependencies extracted from PRD
- Test strategy extracted from PRD
- Acceptance criteria matching PRD
6. DO NOT create subtasks in initial generation - let TaskMaster analyze complexity
Include production-grade criteria in task details field
7. For TaskMaster Complexity Analysis:

After initial tasks.json generation:
1. Run task-master analyze-complexity --research on all tasks
2. Identify high-complexity tasks (≥7)
3. Run task-master expand --id=<X> --research on each high-complexity task
4. Verify expanded subtasks cover all acceptance criteria from PRD

For OpenSpec Integration (when creating OpenSpec proposals):
1. Use PRD section references in proposal motivation
2. Map OpenSpec requirements to PRD functional requirements (FR-[ID].N)
3. Map OpenSpec scenarios to PRD acceptance criteria
4. Include test strategy from PRD in OpenSpec proposal
5. Cross-reference TaskMaster task IDs in OpenSpec proposals
